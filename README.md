## Project Overview
Sales management is crucial for staying competitive and improving distribution methods to reduce costs and increase profits. This project involves analyzing Amazon sales data using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to uncover trends and key metrics. The analysis focuses on monthly, yearly, and yearly-monthly sales trends to provide insights into sales performance.

## ETL Process

### Extract
- **Data Source**: Amazon sales dataset.
- **Description**: Extracted data includes sales transactions, product details, dates, and other relevant attributes. [Learn more about data extraction](https://www.data-science-blog.com/data-extraction).

### Transform
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats. [See data cleaning techniques](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-techniques-with-python-6b85f2c6a15e).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as month-wise and year-wise sales metrics. [Feature engineering in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/08/feature-engineering-in-python/).
- **Aggregation**: Summarized data to compute total sales, average sales per month, and other relevant metrics.

### Load
- **Destination**: Loaded transformed data into a database or data warehouse for analysis. [Explore ETL loading techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/etl-process-and-its-importance/).

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning. [Learn Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and computations. [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization. [Matplotlib guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization. [Seaborn tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations. [Power BI resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).

## Analysis

### Sales Trends
- **Month-wise Trends**: Analyzed sales trends on a monthly basis to identify peak sales periods and seasonal variations. [Monthly sales analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/seasonal-trend-decomposition-of-time-series-with-python-758f5c8f1a93).
- **Year-wise Trends**: Examined year-over-year sales performance to understand long-term growth patterns. [Yearly trend analysis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/25/how-to-use-annual-trend-analysis-to-predict-business-performance/).
- **Yearly-Monthly Trends**: Explored detailed trends on a yearly-monthly basis to identify specific months with significant changes.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Sales**: Aggregated sales revenue over different periods.
- **Average Sales per Month**: Calculated average sales for each month.
- **Sales Growth Rate**: Evaluated the growth rate of sales over time.

### Key Findings
- Identified peak sales periods and seasonal trends.
- Discovered relationships between sales performance and various attributes such as product category and region.
- Analyzed factors influencing sales trends, including promotions, holidays, and market conditions.

## Results
The analysis provides valuable insights into Amazon's sales performance, including:
- Seasonal sales trends and peak periods.
- Long-term growth patterns and key metrics.
- Meaningful relationships between sales and various attributes.
